## 🧠 Key Insights

- Reels typically achieve higher reach and are shared more frequently.
- Some static posts still drive stronger comment-based engagement.
- Optimal engagement tends to occur on specific days and times.
- Posts with high engagement don’t always have the highest reach — quality matters.
